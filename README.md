This is the second game in the PSS series.
This time I used the exercise materials from the past Rifle World Championship 2019. You may get more information about RWC if you look at https://rws2019.com/.

This game contains Shoot-Off also.

To achieve a better result in this game, you need to think about a better game plan before beginning the stage and control yourself during a pass through the stage. So you will feel like a competitor athlete in a match.

This game uses an SQL server to gain leaderboards and achievements.
