The spirit of IPSC competitions inspired us to create this game. 
We think this shooting discipline and competitions are fascinating, dynamic, and useful for all civilian firearms holders.

Athletes work hard to get solid firearm control skills, to gain self-control, and the ability to think right in the process of completing the exercises.

The exercise materials from past ASIA PACIFIC EXTREME OPEN championships are used in this game. You may get more information about W.E.C if you look at https://www.worldextremecup.com/.

This game contains Shoot Off also.

To achieve a better result in this game, you need to think about a better game plan before beginning the stage and control yourself during a pass through the stage. So you will feel yourself like a competitor athlete in a match.
